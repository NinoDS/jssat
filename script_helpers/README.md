# Script Helpers

This folder is dedicated to miscellaneous tools and utilities used during the
development of JSSAT. For example, parsing the official ECMAScript specification
to pragmatically use [Grammarkdown](https://github.com/rbuckton/grammarkdown) to
parse ECMAScript grammar, and generating some corresponding Rust code.
